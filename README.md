# BellyButtonBiodiversity- Module 12 Challenge

The challenge was to build a webpage that utilized Plotly.js. This JavaScript tool allows for the visualization of all kinds of charts from various external file sources. I utilized Bootstrap and other interactive features to create my HTML and stylize it with an actual picture of bacteria from the belly button.  As a random side note the idea of using belly button bacteria to flavor fake beef is absolutely DISGUSTING!!!

## Overview
Through the help of Rosa and her partially completed dashboard, we have a starting point for pulling together the visualization needed of the volunteer information. This will not only allow us to see what bacteria is in each of the volunteers, but let each volunteer check and see where they fall in comparison to everyone else.

The Code was built out to create 3 charts:
  -- Bar Chart - Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
  -- Gauge Chart - Scrubs per Week
  -- Bubble Chart - Bacteria Cultures per Sample
